Release Notes
==============

Release 0.9
-----------

-  **AMD Quark for PyTorch**

   -  New Features

      -  OCP MXFP4 fake quantization and dequantization kernels

         -  Efficient kernels are added to Quark's `torch/kernel/hw_emulation/csrc` for OCP MXFP4 quantization and dequantization. They are useful to simulate OCP MXFP4 workload on hardware that does not support natively this data type (e.g. MI300X GPUs).

   -  Quantized models can be reloaded with no memory overhead

         -  The method ``ModelImporter.import_model_info`` used to reload a quantized model checkpoint now supports using a non-quantized backbone placed on  ``torch.device("meta")`` (`reference <https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/meta.html>`_) device, avoiding the memory overhead of instantiating the non-quantized model on device. More details are available `here <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/export/quark_export_hf.html#loading-quantized-models-saved-in-hugging-face-format-safetensors-format>_`.

              )

              # We only need the backbone/architecture of the original model,
              # not its weights, as weights are loaded from the quantized checkpoint.
