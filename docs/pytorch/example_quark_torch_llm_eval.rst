===================================

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for evaluating LLMs and
VLMs. Types of evaluations supported are summarized by table below.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Ensure that Quark package is installed in your conda environment
2. Install additional requirements for evalautions from:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

User Guide
----------

Below we share a list of recipies that enable the features above. Please
click on each individual links below for more details.

Important Details
-----------------

1. PPL in LM-Eval-Harness vs PPL Feature in Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PPL evaluations generated by (1) above report **token-level** PPL.
We want to note that LM-Eval-Harness also has the ability to calculate
PPL. However, LM-Eval-Harness reports **world-level** PPL. Therefore you
will see a difference between the two PPL results. *We encourage you to
utilize (1) to evaluate PPL as most gold-standard perplexity scores are
reported assuming token-level PPL*.

2. ONNX Exported Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run ROUGE and METEOR evaluations, ONNX models can be OGA exported or
Optimum exported. To run LM-Eval-Harness on ONNX models, we only support
OGA expoorted, currently, since we rely on the ``genai_config.json``
file generated by the OGA Model Builder.

3. Support for VLMs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current list of VLMs supported are
``["Llama-3.2-11B-Vision", "Llama-3.2-90B-Vision", "Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct", "Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct"]``.
